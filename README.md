# Iris-Flower-Species-Prediction
This is a very simple project that provides predictions based on the dimenstions of the Iris flower petals. The front end is basic html and bootstrap that is hosted by a simple flask frame work.

The user interface is basic and self-intutive the iris flower analysis python file however is contains detailed analysis with correlation comparisons and heatmaps. 

I still havent deployed the application in Heroku but I soon will. 

Feel free to try it out! :v:
